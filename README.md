Running the Project:
1.Install NodeJS and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2.Download or clone the tutorial project source code.
3.Install all required npm packages by running "npm install" from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).
4.Start the application by running "npm start" from the command line in the project root folder.
5.Your browser should automatically open at http://localhost:8080 with the login page of the demo React role-based authorization app displayed.


The React user type based access control app uses a mock backend so it can run in the browser without a real api. 
The _components folder contains shared React components that can be used anywhere in the application.
The helpers folder contains all the bits and pieces that don't fit into other folders.
The mock backend is implemented by monkey patching the fetch() function to intercept certain api requests and mimic the behaviour of a real api.
